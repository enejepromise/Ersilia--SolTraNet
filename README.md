## eos6oli-Model-Validation
This is Ersilia's week 2 Task for Outreachy Summer 2024 contribution. This repository is a model validation for eos6oli.

## Model Abstract
Accurate prediction of aqueous solubility has been a challenge in drug recovery. 
This model will be used to solve the challenge of getting accurate prediction of aqueous solubility in drug recovery,
SolTraNet will be used, a molecule attention transformer to predict aqueous solubility from a molecule's SMILES representation.
